bpy PyPI Package: Blender now provides pre-compiled bpy wheels (v5.0.0) via pip, enabling true integration testing with real Blender objects instead of mocks. Install with 'pip install bpy', use try/except for graceful fallback when unavailable, and mark tests with @pytest.mark.skipif(not HAS\_BLENDER). Applied successfully - all 43 tests pass including 4 real Blender integration tests. Pattern: check PyPI for pre-compiled binaries before building mocks for heavy dependencies.
