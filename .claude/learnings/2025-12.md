Cache System Architecture: terrain-maker uses two hash-based cache systems - DEMCache (src/terrain/cache.py) for merged DEM .npz files and MeshCache (src/terrain/mesh_cache.py) for Blender .blend files. Both use SHA256 hashing of inputs (file paths + mtimes, or DEM hash + mesh params) for invalidation. Pattern: compute_hash → check_cache → compute_and_save. Future work (Issue #4) will extend this for snow analysis with dependency graph caching for sequential computations.

OpenStreetMap Integration: Use Overpass API with [timeout:90] for large bbox queries (11°x10°). Deduplicate results by name. Key OSM tags for XC skiing: piste:type=nordic, sport=cross-country_skiing, landuse=winter_sports, route=ski
