Road smoothing pipeline: mask → smooth → offset. Smoothing flattens road surface texture (road-only Gaussian in 2D grid space), then offset raises roads above terrain. The smoothing intentionally excludes non-road neighbors so roads become smoother than surrounding terrain, not pulled toward terrain height. The old 1D gaussian_filter1d approach was broken - it smoothed in vertex index order, not spatial order. Fixed to use 2D gaussian_filter with normalized convolution on the reconstructed Z grid.
